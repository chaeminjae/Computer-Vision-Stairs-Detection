# Computer-Vision-Stairs-Detection

## WELCOME

This is one of my computer vision projects. The goal of this project is to implement computer vision to detect stairs for lower-limb exoskeleton. The model shoul be able to detect and differentiate the stairs that going up and going down. To do this, I train my model using YOLO implemented on darkflow framework.

The data used in this project is provide by bircatmcri on this link: https://github.com/bircatmcri/MCIndoor20000

The source code is on code.md

Cheers!
